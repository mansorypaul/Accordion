                        Tanzania for many years has been a home to thousands of native tribes and people of different origins, and culture. Tanzania is the home of 120 African ethnic groups and more than 26 million people live in this East African country. You will be amazed to encounter and closely interact with the Maasai people of Tanzania who will show you how to light a fire without any combustibles. Other lesser-known tribes like the Datoga and Chaga and their rich cultural tapestry can be explored in your Tanzania walking or cultural tours.

                            It is advisable to book your international flight tickets at least three months in advance if you do not wish to face problems getting seats on British Airways or KLM. If you are planning your trip in the peak season, it is advisable to book your safari to Tanzania at least nine months before.
